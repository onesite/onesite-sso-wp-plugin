Unify multiple sites and enable Social Login using ONEsite's Single-Sign-On plugin.  

== Description ==
ONEsite SSO provides a powerful single sign-on solution for your Drupal-powered sites. Extend the capabilities of your site to easily engage with new customers, create a vibrant community around your products, and increase customer conversions.

* Give your users a single, seamless, login for all of your sites.
* Authenticate users via Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and other OpenID providers.
* Allow your users to link multiple social accounts to their master account.

This module will override the default login and registration forms providing, instead, a link to launch the ONEsite Social Login modal window. This modal will be responsible for authenticating and registering a user on your site.
